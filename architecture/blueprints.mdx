## Customization

All blueprints can be customized based on specific requirements:

- **Networking**: Customize VPC and firewall rules
- **Security**: Add or remove security controls
- **Monitoring**: Adjust monitoring and alerting

## Implementation

Each blueprint has corresponding Terraform modules:

```hcl
# Example: Standard Production
module "production" {
  source = "./modules/blueprints/standard-production"
  
  project_id = var.project_id
  region     = var.region
  # ... other variables
}
```
