# Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles that guide the architecture and implementation of the Google Cloud infrastructure for Agentic AI solutions, incorporating Konecta's global enterprise architecture blueprint.

---

## 1. Security First 🔒

Security is not an afterthought—it's built into every layer of the infrastructure. This aligns with Konecta's zero-trust model.

### Principles

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify, enforced via **Chrome Enterprise Premium (CEP)**, **Security Gateway (SG)**, and **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** assigned to groups, not individual users.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls, including WAF rules via **Cloud Armor** and granular firewall policies.
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

### Implementation

- IAM roles with minimal required permissions.
- VPC Service Controls for API security.
- Cloud KMS for key management.
- **Mandatory MFA** policies enforced by **Keycloak**.
- **VMs are not allowed public IP addresses**.

## 2. Global Governance & Standardization 🗺️

Implement a unified, secure, and scalable foundation across all regions.

### Principles

- **Standardized Landing Zone [K01]**: Implement a single, scalable, and secure architecture as a starting point for all countries/regions.
- **Shared Global Governance [K02]**: Deploy within a **single Google Cloud organization** with shared responsibility between global corporate and regional country teams.
- **Hierarchical Structure [RM02]**: Utilize the folder hierarchy (**Organization > Environments > Regions > Countries**) to enforce global organizational policies, IAM, and firewall policies.
- **Standard Naming Convention [RM04]**: Define and enforce a standardized naming convention via IaC for clarity and consistency.

### Implementation

- Global teams manage the initial landing zone and global policies (access, security, networking, billing).
- Regional teams deploy and manage their applications following global policies.
- Segregation of **PROD**, **STG**, **DEV**, and **LGC** environments using different folders.

## 3. Reliability & Business Continuity  uptime

The system must be available and resilient to failure (HA and DR).

### Principles

- **High Availability (HA) [K06.1]**: Achieved through **multi-zonal deployments** and regional zonal replication.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) [K06.2]**: Achieved through **multi-regional deployments**, backups, and cross-region replication for critical systems.
- **Redundancy**: No single points of failure.
- **Fault-Tolerant Networking**: Networks will be designed for fault-tolerant, scalable configurations.

### Implementation

- All critical production applications must use appropriate business continuity configurations (HA, DR, backups).
- Cloud Router with dynamic routing (BGP) for hybrid connectivity.

## 4. Networking & Regional Isolation 🌐

Implement a centralized, isolated, and secure network topology.

### Principles

- **Hub & Spoke Architecture [K03]**: Networks in each country/region will follow a hub & spoke architecture. The **hub** is the central point for shared services and external connectivity; **spokes** are for individual application deployments.
- **Network Regional Isolation [K04]**: Each country/region will have its own hub and spoke, with **no network connectivity between regional networks**.
- **Shared VPCs**: Spokes will be implemented using Shared VPCs for centralized network connectivity (host project) and app deployment (service projects).
- **Private Connectivity**: VPC peering between spokes is to be avoided; **Private Service Connect** is preferred for inter-spoke communication.

### Implementation

- Hybrid connectivity (Partner Interconnect/HA VPN) routes through the central hub.
- **Cloud DNS** is used for centralized DNS management in the hub VPC, using DNS forwarding to on-premises networks and DNS peering to spokes.
- Egress to the internet is disabled by default for spokes; enabled via **Cloud NAT** if needed.

## 5. Workload Migration & Innovation 🚀

Focus on modernization and leveraging cloud-native capabilities.

### Principles

- **Cloud Native First [K07.1]**: Migrate applications to **serverless and managed services** wherever possible to improve agility and performance.
- **Modern Workplace**: Implement solutions like **Google Workspace** and **Chrome OS Flex** to enhance collaboration and productivity.
- **Innovation**: Leverage Google Cloud’s capabilities in data analytics, machine learning, and AI.

### Implementation

- Applications requiring VMware compatibility will initially use **Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE)**.
- Lift-and-shift applications will be deployed on a dedicated **Legacy (LGC) environment**.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code & DevOps ⚙️

Automate deployment and configuration to ensure reproducibility and reliability.

### Principles

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) [K08.1]**: All infrastructure will be deployed using **Terraform**, structured as modular and repeatable configurations.
- **CI/CD [K08.2]**: All application code and content will be built, tested, and deployed using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment tools.
- **No Manual Deployment**: No production applications will be deployed or configured manually by humans.
- **Centralized Monitoring [K08.3]**: **Cloud Operations Suite** will be the default platform for centralized monitoring and management.

### Implementation

- Automated deployments via IaC and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Cloud Audit Logs** for auditing all administrative actions and group membership changes.

## Trade-offs

Every design decision involves trade-offs. We prioritize:

1. **Security** over convenience.
2. **Reliability** over cost (within reason).
3. **Regional Isolation** over cross-country network simplicity.
4. **Automation** over manual processes.

## Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions, consider:

1. **Global Principles**: Does this comply with the Konecta global and technical design principles (K01-K08)?
2. **Security**: Does this improve or maintain security
