## Implementation

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: go test ./test/...
      - run: terraform validate
      - run: checkov -d terraform/
```

## Best Practices

- Run tests on every commit
- Fail fast on errors
- Test in isolated environments
- Automate security scanning
