# 🎉 Post-Installation Setup for CrewAI Platform

## 🌟 Overview

After successfully deploying the CrewAI Platform infrastructure, these initial setup steps are necessary to configure the core system, set up permissions, and prepare the environment for use.

---

## ⚙️ Initial Setup Tasks

These tasks must be run immediately after installation to configure the internal organization and administration access.

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize Internal Organization">
Run the following command to initialize the required internal organization, typically named "Default."

```bash  theme={null}
kubectl exec -it deploy/crewai-web -- rake studio:install_internal_organization
````

</Step>
<Step title="Set Up Default Permissions"\>
Configure the default permission set and assign the initial owner role. **Replace `admin@company.com` with your desired administrator's email address.**

```bash  theme={null}
# Replace with your admin email
kubectl exec -it deploy/crewai-web -- \
  rake factory:setup_permissions_defaults 'factory:add_owner[2,admin@company.com]'
```

</Step>
<Step title="Fix Missing 'Operate' Tab (Troubleshoot)"\>
If the **"Operate"** tab is missing in the Web UI, you may need to manually assign the `Owner` role to your user via the Rails console.

**1. Shell into the `crewai-web` pod:**

```bash  theme={null}
kubectl exec --stdin --tty deploy/crewai-web -- /bin/bash
```

**2. Start the Rails console:**

```bash  theme={null}
bin/rails c
```

**3. Define the role assignment function (paste this code block):**

```ruby
def assign_owner_role(user_email)
  user = User.find_by(email: user_email)
  organization = Organization.find_by(name: "Default")
  owner_role = organization.roles.find_by(name: "Owner")
  membership = organization.memberships.find_by(user_id: user.id)
  membership.update!(role_id: owner_role.id)
end
```

**4. Run the assignment function (replace with your user email):**

```bash
assign_owner_role("nathan.booth@konecta.com")
```

**5. Exit the Rails shell (Ctrl+D) and refresh your browser.**
</Step>
</Steps>

## 🚀 Enable Studio V2 (Optional)

Studio V2 is the next-generation interface and agent capability for CrewAI.

<Steps\>
<Step title="Check LLM Connection and Delete Old Crews"\>
Ensure you have an LLM connection named **`studio-v2`** configured. Then, shell into the web-service pod and delete any old Studio crew deployments.

**1. Shell into the web-service pod and run:**

```bash  theme={null}
bin/rails c
```

**2. Paste and run the following commands in the Rails console:**

```ruby
Provisioner::DeleteProvisionedCrewJob.perform_later(Deployment.find_by_slug(Studio::Install::Const::STUDIO_V2_AGENT_SLUG).id)
Provisioner::DeleteProvisionedCrewJob.perform_later(Deployment.find_by_slug(Studio::Install::Const::STUDIO_RUNNER_AGENT_SLUG).id)
```

</Step>
<Step title="Install the Studio Agent"\>
Exit the Rails shell (Ctrl+D) and install the core Studio Agent. This process can take up to **\~10 minutes**.

```bash  theme={null}
INTERNAL_ORGANIZATION_NAME=CrewAI ORGANIZATION_ID=1 rake studio:agent:install
```

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Agent Status and Sync Tools"\>
Continuously check the agent status until it reports **"Crew is Online"**. Then, sync and re-index the available tools.

```bash  theme={null}
# Check status - wait until it says "Crew is Online"
rake studio:agent:status

# Sync and re-index tools
rake studio:tools:sync_crewai_tools
rake studio:tools:reindex_tools
```

</Step>
<Step title="Install the Studio Runner"\>
Install the Studio Runner agent, which handles the execution environment. Wait for 10 minutes for the deployment process to fully complete before testing.

```bash  theme={null}
INTERNAL_ORGANIZATION_NAME=CrewAI rake studio:runner:install
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## 🌐 Accessing the Application

Use the appropriate method to access the CrewAI Web UI based on your deployment environment.

### Development Access (Port Forwarding)

Ideal for quick testing or development environments.

```bash  theme={null}
# Forward web service port (2603 is the external port, 80 is the internal service port)
kubectl port-forward svc/crewai-web 2603:80

# Access in browser
open http://localhost:2603
```

### Production Access (Ingress / LoadBalancer)

| Method | Command to Find Endpoint | Access URL Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingress** | `kubectl get ing crewai-ingress` | `https://crewai.company.com` (If hostname configured) |
| **LoadBalancer** | `kubectl get svc crewai-web` | `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:80` (Use the EXTERNAL-IP from the output) |

-----

## ✅ Verification Steps

After completing all setup tasks, verify the platform's readiness:

1.  **Access the Web UI** using one of the methods above.
2.  **Log in** with your configured authentication provider.
3.  **Verify admin access** by confirming the presence of administrative links/tabs.
4.  **Test basic functionality** by creating a test crew or project.
5.  **Check background workers** for successful job processing:

<!-- end list -->

```bash  theme={null}
kubectl logs -l app=crewai-worker --tail=50
```
