# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with deploying the Google Cloud infrastructure for Agentic AI solutions in under 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- [ ] Terraform >= 1.5.0 installed
- [ ] Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) installed and configured
- [ ] Appropriate IAM permissions (see [Prerequisites](/developer-guide/prerequisites))
- [ ] Git installed

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gcp-iac-repo.git
cd gcp-iac-repo
```

## Step 2: Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
# Login to Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Set your project
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
```

## Step 3: Configure Terraform Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory:

```hcl
project_id     = "your-gcp-project-id"
region         = "us-central1"
zone           = "us-central1-a"
environment    = "dev"

# Optional: Customize these values
network_name   = "agentic-ai-network"
subnet_name    = "agentic-ai-subnet"
```

## Step 4: Initialize Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

This will download the required Terraform providers and modules.

## Step 5: Review the Deployment Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

Review the resources that will be created. This is a dry-run that shows what Terraform will do without making any changes.

## Step 6: Deploy the Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the deployment. This will create:

- VPC network and subnets
- Firewall rules
- Compute instances (if configured)
- Storage buckets
- IAM roles and service accounts
- Basic monitoring and logging

## Step 7: Verify Deployment

After deployment completes, verify the infrastructure:

```bash
# List created resources
gcloud compute networks list
gcloud compute instances list
gcloud storage buckets list

# Check Terraform outputs
terraform output
```

## Step 8: Access Your Infrastructure

Once deployed, you can:

1. **SSH into instances** (if created):
   ```bash
   gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_NAME --zone=ZONE
   ```

2. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance" --limit 50
   ```

3. **Check monitoring**:
   - Visit [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Navigate to Monitoring > Dashboards

## Common Next Steps

### Deploy Application Services

After the foundation is deployed, you can deploy application-specific services:

```bash
cd terraform/modules/app-services
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Configure CI/CD

Set up continuous deployment:

```bash
cd .github/workflows
# Review and customize GitHub Actions workflows
```

### Set Up Monitoring

Configure custom dashboards and alerts:

```bash
cd terraform/modules/monitoring
terraform apply
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you encounter authentication errors:

```bash
# Re-authenticate
gcloud auth application-default login

# Verify credentials
gcloud auth list
```

### Permission Errors

Ensure your account has the required IAM roles:

```bash
# Check your roles
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID --flatten="bindings[].members" --filter="bindings.members:user:YOUR_EMAIL"
```

### Terraform State Issues

If you encounter state lock issues:

```bash
# Force unlock (use with caution)
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID
```

## Clean Up (Development Only)

To remove all created resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will delete all infrastructure. Only use this in development environments.

## What's Next?

Now that you have the basic infrastructure deployed:

1. **Review the Architecture**: Understand the system design in [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview)
2. **Customize Configuration**: Learn about [Terraform Variables](/terraform/variables)
3. **Deploy Services**: Follow the [Developer Guide](/developer-guide/deployment)
4. **Set Up Security**: Review [Security Documentation](/security/overview)

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Browse the full documentation
- **Issues**: Check existing issues or create a new one
- **Support**: Contact the platform team
