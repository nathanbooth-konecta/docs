## Configuration

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "audit_config" {
  project = var.project_id

  service = "allServices"

  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "ADMIN_READ"
  }

  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_READ"
  }

  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_WRITE"
  }
}
```
