# IAM Configuration

This document describes Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration for the infrastructure.

## Overview

IAM controls who has what access to which resources in Google Cloud.

## Service Accounts

### Creating Service Accounts

```hcl
resource "google_service_account" "app" {
  account_id   = "app-service"
  display_name = "Application Service Account"
  description  = "Service account for application workloads"
}
```

### Granting Permissions

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_member" "app_permissions" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/cloudsql.client"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.app.email}"
}
```

## Custom Roles

### Creating Custom Roles

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "custom_role" {
  role_id     = "customAppRole"
  title       = "Custom Application Role"
  description = "Custom role with minimal permissions"
  permissions = [
    "storage.objects.get",
    "storage.objects.list"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use least privilege
- Use service accounts for applications
- Create custom roles when needed
- Regular access reviews
