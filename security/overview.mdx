# Security Overview

This document provides an overview of the security architecture, controls, and best practices implemented in the Google Cloud infrastructure for Agentic AI solutions.

## Security Principles

Our security approach is built on these core principles:

1. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
5. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
6. **Secure by Default**: Security built into every component

## Security Layers

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Service Accounts**
- Dedicated service accounts for each application/service
- Minimal required permissions per service account
- Workload Identity for GKE (if applicable)

**User Access**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Custom IAM roles with least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required

**Organization Policies**
- Enforce security policies at the organization level
- Prevent insecure configurations
- Require specific security settings

### 2. Network Security

**VPC Configuration**
- Private subnets for internal resources
- Public subnets only when necessary
- Network segmentation by function

**Firewall Rules**
- Default deny-all ingress
- Explicit allow rules for required traffic
- Network tags for resource grouping
- Service account-based firewall rules

**Private Google Access**
- Enable private access to Google APIs
- No public IPs required for API access
- Reduced attack surface

**VPC Service Controls**
- Perimeter security for APIs
- Prevent data exfiltration
- Control service-to-service communication

### 3. Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest**
- Cloud Storage: Encrypted by default
- Cloud SQL: Encryption enabled
- Compute Engine: Encrypted persistent disks
- Cloud KMS for key management

**Encryption in Transit**
- TLS 1.2+ for all external communications
- Internal service-to-service: mTLS where possible
- SSL/TLS termination at load balancers

**Key Management**
- Cloud KMS for encryption keys
- Key rotation policies
- Separate keys per environment
- Audit logging for key usage

### 4. Secrets Management

**Secret Manager**
- Store API keys, passwords, and certificates
- Versioning and rotation support
- IAM-based access control
- Audit logging

**Best Practices**
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use Secret Manager for all secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Limit access to secrets

### 5. Application Security

**Container Security**
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Regular image updates

**API Security**
- API authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Output encoding

**Dependency Management**
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

**Cloud Logging**
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log retention policies
- Log-based metrics and alerts
- Export to BigQuery for analysis

**Cloud Monitoring**
- Security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Alerting on security events
- Custom dashboards

**Cloud Audit Logs**
- Admin activity logs
- Data access logs
- System event logs
- Compliance and forensics

## Security Controls by Component

### Compute Resources

- **Shielded VMs**: Secure boot, vTPM, integrity monitoring
- **OS Login**: SSH key management via IAM
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive ingress/egress
- **Service Accounts**: Minimal permissions

### Storage

- **Bucket Policies**: IAM and ACL controls
- **Encryption**: Default encryption enabled
- **Versioning**: Protect against accidental deletion
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic data management

### Databases

- **Private IP**: No public IP addresses
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups
- **Access Control**: IAM and database users

### Networking

- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **Cloud Armor**: DDoS protection and WAF
- **Cloud NAT**: Outbound traffic through NAT
- **Private Service Connect**: Secure service access

## Compliance

### Standards and Frameworks

- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (if applicable)

### Compliance Controls

- Regular security assessments
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Compliance audits
- Documentation and evidence

## Incident Response

### Detection

- Automated security monitoring
- Alerting on suspicious activities
- Threat intelligence integration
- Regular security reviews

### Response

- Incident response procedures
- Escalation paths
- Communication plans
- Post-incident reviews

### Recovery

- Backup and restore procedures
- Disaster recovery plans
- Business continuity planning
- Lessons learned process

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use service accounts** with minimal permissions
3. **Validate inputs** in applications
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Follow secure coding practices**

### For Operators

1. **Regular security updates** for all resources
2. **Monitor security alerts** and respond promptly
3. **Review access logs** regularly
4. **Rotate credentials** on schedule
5. **Conduct security audits** periodically

### For Administrators

1. **Enforce organization policies**
2. **Regular access reviews**
3. **Security training** for team
4. **Incident response drills**
5. **Stay current** with security advisories
